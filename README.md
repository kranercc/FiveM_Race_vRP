## Demo

>Here you can see the default UI when `/race` is executed

>If you click any map you can select a game mode you want to play from the pre-sets (there are in total _4_ of them)

>If the map ends up being bigger and can't fit or can't be seen in the small window, there is logic written to scale it and "zoom" it for better visuals

>Here you can see the arrows pointing to UI elements, they are used to guide the client to use the script correctly even if he is not familiar with it, also setting a waypoint to the destionation so it's easy to follow

# Code Breakdown

When the user hits Escape to exit the UI, an event is triggered to get the information into the server and client side

``` js
var data = {}
data.lobby = {}
function send_data() { $.post('https://race/race_main',JSON.stringify(data)) }


document.onkeyup = function(data) {
        if (data.key == "Escape") {
            display(false)
            send_data()
            /*code*/
```

The lobby is handled by the server like so
```lua

RegisterNetEvent("race:send_data_to_lobby_members")
AddEventHandler("race:send_data_to_lobby_members", function (data)    

    table.insert(lobbies, data.lobby) 
    for _, lobby_data in pairs(data.lobby) do
        user_id = tonumber(lobby_data.id)
        local player = vRP.getUserSource({user_id})
        TriggerClientEvent("race:build_game", player, data.lobby) 
    end
end)

```

It will all go into a `table` and from there the server check every second for changes


```lua

CreateThread(function()
    while true do
        Wait(1000)
        if #lobbies > 0 then
            for _, lobby in pairs(lobbies) do
                local counter = 0
                for __, player in pairs(lobby) do
                    if player.ready then
                        counter = counter + 1
                    end
                end
                if counter > 0 and counter == #lobby then
                    for __, player in pairs(lobby) do
                        TriggerClientEvent("race:startRaceGUI", vRP.getUserSource({tonumber(player.id)}))
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
end)
```


The server sends data to client using this events registered in the client

```lua
RegisterNetEvent("race:build_game")
AddEventHandler("race:build_game", function (data)
    game_mode = data[1].game_mode
    racing = true
end)

RegisterNetEvent("race:startRace")
AddEventHandler("race:startRace", function ()
    racing = true
end)

RegisterNetEvent("race:startRaceGUI")
AddEventHandler("race:startRaceGUI", function ()
    race_started = true
end)
```
